-- | Assist: Feedback Service
-- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Definition: gives feedback on a student product, as a sub-category of
-- | the Assist service. A student product might be an essay, a program,
-- | a step in a calculation, an answer to a question, or something else.
-- |
-- | 'p' represents the student product (e.g., an essay, code, or answer),
-- | 'm' is the model used to evaluate it, and 'f' is the resulting feedback.
-- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Evaluates a student product against a model and produces feedback.
class EvaluateProduct p m f | p m -> f where
  evaluate_product :: p -> m -> f
-- | The generic assist-feedback function maps a student product and model to
--   a feedback object.
assist_feedback :: EvaluateProduct p m f => p -> m -> f
assist_feedback = evaluate_product
-- | Evaluates a batch of student products against the same model.
--   Returns each product paired with its feedback, preserving order.
--   Useful for grading or flagging a whole submission set at once.
assist_feedback_batch :: EvaluateProduct p m f => [p] -> m -> [(p, f)]
assist_feedback_batch products model =
  map (\p -> (p, evaluate_product p model)) products
-- | Iteratively revises a product until the feedback satisfies a criterion,
--   or a maximum number of evaluation cycles is exhausted.
--   The revision function updates the product given the current feedback.
--   Returns the final (product, feedback) pair and the number of cycles performed.
