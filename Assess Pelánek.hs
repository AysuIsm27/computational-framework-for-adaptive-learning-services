-- | A student-item answer is treated as a match between the student and the item.
-- | P(correct) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(q_s - d_i)))
-- | After each answer both the student skill q_s and item difficulty d_i are updated:
-- |   q_s := q_s + U(n_s) * (correct - P(correct))
-- |   d_i := d_i - U(n_i) * (correct - P(correct))
-- | where U(n) = a / (1 + b*n) is the uncertainty function (Section 2.3),
-- | with recommended defaults a=1, b=0.05.
-- | The PFAE extension (Section 2.5) uses separate gains g (correct) and d (incorrect)
-- | to distinguish learning from evidence of non-mastery.
-- | Item difficulty d_i is estimated from all previous students' answers (peer data).
