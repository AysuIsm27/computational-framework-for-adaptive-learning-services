-- | Provides scaffold support for the current task.

-- | The first function decides which scaffold, if any, should be given.
-- | The second function applies that scaffold to the task.
--
-- | If no scaffold is needed, the task is returned unchanged.
-- | Fading happens over repeated calls as the learner model and task change.
