-- | A topic in the domain model (e.g. a Java programming concept).

-- | A single practice activity attempt by a student on a topic.
-- | The raw interaction data from which the learner model is built.

  , attemptSuccess   :: Bool    -- ^ whether the attempt was correct
  , attemptTimestamp :: Double  -- ^ time of attempt
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | state as a mastery level per topic, derived from practice activity logs.
-- | Visualized as a grid of topic-level mastery bars for the student.

  , topicMastery :: [(Topic, Double)]  -- ^ topic -> mastery level in [0,1]

-- | aggregate model used for social comparison.
-- | Exposes peer models and the class average per topic.

  { peerModels   :: [LearnerModel]      -- ^ individual peer models
